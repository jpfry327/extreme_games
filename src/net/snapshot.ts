/**
 * Snapshot serialization — the Layer A "wire format" between server and client.
 *
 * A Snapshot is the serializable subset of World: players, projectiles, and the
 * tick counter. The architecture (§5) keeps this separate from GameEvent[]
 * (transient "what happened" records); for the in-process loopback of M2.0 we
 * include events in the snapshot as a convenience — a real WebSocket protocol
 * would send them as a separate channel (M2.1).
 *
 * `serializeSnapshotFor(world, playerId)` builds a deep copy of the world for
 * one client. The `playerId` parameter is the per-client filter seam: stealth /
 * area-of-interest culling land here in M5. For now we send everything.
 *
 * `applySnapshot(clientWorld, snap)` overwrites the client world entirely. The
 * client world is NEVER stepped — it is purely driven by these snapshots.
